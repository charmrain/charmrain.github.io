## About Me
Hi, I’m **Raymond An** — a **Data Scientist** and **AI Generative Engineer** by trade.  
I spend my days wrangling messy datasets, fine-tuning machine learning models, and building AI-powered systems that (hopefully) make life smarter and a bit more interesting.

When I’m not deep in code, you’ll probably find me outdoors, at a sports event, or reading until my coffee gets cold.

## Life Outside of Work
I’m not all algorithms and APIs. I’m also:
- 🏕️ A passionate outdoor explorer — forests, mountains, and lakes are my happy places  
- ⚽ A borderline-obsessed sports fan (don’t ask about my all-time soccer XI unless you have a spare hour)  
- 🌌 A lifelong stargazer — humbled by galaxies, fascinated by black holes  
- 📚 A serious reader — from non-fiction and history to the occasional machine learning research paper

## What You’ll Find Here
This site is my digital hideout — part blog, part personal notebook, part experiment lab.  
I write about:
- Data science, AI, and generative tech
- My travels and outdoor adventures
- Book notes and random ideas worth sharing
