## Hey there 👋 I'm Raymond

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **AI Generative Engineer** by day...  
And by night? Well, you'll probably find me **hiking under the stars**, catching a game, or nose-deep in a book with a flashlight.

By profession, I wrangle data, fine-tune models, and build intelligent systems that (hopefully) make life smarter. I love solving real-world problems with machine learning, especially in the creative chaos of generative AI.

But I’m not all code and coffee.

I'm also:
- 🏕️ A passionate outdoor explorer — forests, mountains, and lakes are my happy places  
- ⚽ A borderline-obsessed sports fan (don’t ask me about my all-time soccer XI unless you have a spare hour)  
- 🌌 A lifelong stargazer — humbled by galaxies, fascinated by black holes  
- 📚 A serious reader — from wide range of non-fiction to American History to machine learning papers (kidding!)

This site is my little digital hideout — a place to blog, reflect, and occasionally rant. You’ll find thoughts on tech, life, books, stars, and whatever else grabs my neurons.

So grab a cup of coffee, or lace up your hiking boots — let’s wander through ideas together 🚀
