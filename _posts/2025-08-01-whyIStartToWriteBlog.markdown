# The reason I start to write

When people grow older, it always feel the urge to say something and express my thought.

I fully appreciate Github has this functionality that allows everyone to set one's own blog, and express one's thought without any censorship.

Of cause, not everyone has the technical background to set up a homepage or a website, as well as not every programmer has the incentive to write something other than show case their tech skills.

For me, I am fully cherish the opportunity to write something in my own platform, using this "advance" method to publish and record the moment of my thought.

Cheers! I hope I can write more and express myself well and freely.
