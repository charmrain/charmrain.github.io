<!-- The story of the [Viking ship][vikingship] tells of 12 brave people, most from Moorhead, who built a traditional-style Viking vessel and sailed it across the Great Lakes, through the Atlantic Ocean, and all the way to Norway.  

The ship is preserved indoors, with the crew’s story displayed along the walls. -->

### Medora

This is a replica of an 11th-century [Viking church][Stave_Church]. Visitors can step inside to imagine what Christian rituals felt like a thousand years ago. -->

<!-- ### Fargo
A short drive from Moorhead took me to the **Fargo Air Museum**.  
It has two hangars open for tours, with an admission fee of $15 for adults.

Most planes are part of U.S. Air Force history and are not to be touched.  
Fargo itself is a quiet city, with a large airfield in its northern part.
